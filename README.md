# SalesAnalysis_Pandas
Real day-to-day example of data science tasks completed using Pandas library on Python. 
Additionally MatPlotlib, was used to plot the results.


# How to setup on your machine:

Download all the files, including the dir of Sales_Data, which has all the data from sales throughout the year. 
Instead of that it is possible to run it only from the "all_data.csv", just delete the 2nd Script. 
I used VSCode to compile everything. To use VSCode like a Jupyter Notebook, save the file as '.ipynb' instead of '.py' after installing Python Extension on VSCode.
